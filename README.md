Eco_Run - Created a webpage using HTML,CSS AND JS (for a hackathon)

## Inspiration
Beyond the alarming headlines, several key inspirations fueled our journey:
* The Urgency of the IPCC (intergovernmental panel of climate change) Reports: The stark scientific consensus on the human impact on climate change and the limited window for action resonated deeply. I felt a moral imperative to use our skills to contribute to solutions.
* The Power of Individual Action: While systemic change is crucial, we believed that empowering individuals with knowledge and tools to understand and reduce their carbon footprint could create a significant collective impact.
* The Potential of Technology for Good: As computer science enthusiasts, I am excited by the prospect of leveraging technology – data analysis, mobile applications, and user-centric design – to promote sustainable behaviour.
* Local Community Concerns: Witnessing the direct impact of climate change on our city, from waterlogging to heatwaves, motivated us to create a tool that could be relevant and beneficial to our local community.

## How we built it - 
The EcoRun website is designed to promote eco-friendly habits by allowing users to track their carbon footprint and engage with a community of like-minded individuals. The site features a user-friendly form where users can input their name, weight, distance walked, and time taken, as well as select their mode of transportation to calculate their environmental impact. A dynamic leaderboard and progress bar visually display user achievements, while an avatar section provides a personalised and motivational touch.

 The weekly challenge section encourages users to meet specific goals, such as walking 20km, to earn badges. Additionally, the site includes an eco-news section to keep users informed about the latest environmental updates, a calendar for eco-events, and a community posts section for sharing thoughts and tips. The responsive design ensures accessibility across devices, and the footer provides quick links and social media connections to enhance user engagement. The entire project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Chart.js for data visualisation and incorporating interactive elements like dark mode and toast notifications for a modern, engaging user experience.

## Challenges we ran into - 

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

1. **🌐 Ensuring Accurate CO₂ Calculations**
   Finding reliable emission rates for different transport modes and implementing precise calculations for varied user inputs required extensive research and testing.

2. **📊 Chart.js Integration & Responsiveness**
   Embedding Chart.js for live impact visualization while keeping charts responsive across devices took fine-tuning and layout adjustments.

3. **🌗 Dark Mode Persistence**
   Implementing a dark mode toggle that remembers user preference across sessions with `localStorage` introduced complexity in theme management and CSS overrides.

4. **🏅 Badge Logic and Threshold Handling**
   Designing a reward system based on CO₂ saved required careful condition checks and dynamic DOM updates to avoid logic conflicts.

5. **🔥 Streak Tracking Across Days**
   Creating a reliable streak tracker involved comparing current and previous dates, managing local storage correctly, and handling edge cases like missed days.

6. **🧑 Avatar Preview System**
   Dynamically loading avatar GIFs based on selection while preventing performance issues or broken links posed design and loading challenges.

7. **📱 Mobile Responsiveness**
   Maintaining layout consistency and interactivity across various screen sizes—especially for forms, charts, and community posts—was time-consuming.

8. **🧩 UI Overlap and Element Conflicts**
   With many floating elements (buttons, popups, toasts), ensuring they didn’t overlap or interfere with user input required careful z-index management.

9. **🔄 Data Persistence Without a Backend**
   Storing streaks, avatar preferences, and form interactions locally using only browser storage had limits and required fallbacks for privacy and reliability.

10. **🧪 Testing Multiple Interactive Features**
    With dark mode, badges, leaderboard, posts, and more, testing all features together to prevent bugs and UI glitches was a major QA effort.

Also Being a CS Student in University still learning it was a great way to showcase my web-programming skills which i just learned and making me realise how difficult it can be to make a good website definitely wont be stopping here will try to make this website a real-life path breaker over the coming years by gaining exposure and doing research 🔬😁
